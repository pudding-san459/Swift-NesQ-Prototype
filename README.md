Research on application to implement
- We have done some research on what applications that we will implement for our app. So basically our app will require a geobase location which we will be using a Map Kit in the Xcode. MapKit for SwiftUIÂ allows you to build map-centric views and apps across Apple platforms.This feature will help to determine the location of the users and the community post will display posting based on the specific radius meters by locations. You can design expressive and highly interactive Maps with minimal code by composing views, using ViewBuilders and view modifiers. Other than that, we also will be using a camera. The camera is for users when they need to report any lost pets or any animals wandering in the neighbourhood.
